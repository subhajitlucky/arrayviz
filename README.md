# ArrayViz - Master Array Algorithms Visually

ArrayViz is an interactive educational platform designed to help students and developers master array data structures and algorithms through visualization. Whether you're a first-year Computer Science student or preparing for technical interviews, ArrayViz provides a comprehensive, visual, and intuitive way to learn.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **Core Concepts Visualized**
   - **Memory Layout**: See how arrays are stored in contiguous memory.
   - **Indexing**: Understand O(1) access with visual formulas.
   - **Operations**: Interactive visualizations for Insertion, Deletion, and Traversal.
   - **Dynamic Arrays**: Watch how arrays resize and handle capacity.
   - **2D Arrays**: Visualize row-major order and matrix traversal.

### 2. **Algorithmic Patterns**
   Master 21 essential coding patterns with step-by-step visualizations:
   - **Two Pointers**: Visualizing convergence and swapping.
   - **Sliding Window**: Dynamic window resizing and tracking.
   - **Fast & Slow Pointers**: Cycle detection (Floyd's) and middle finding.
   - **Prefix Sums**: Range query optimization.
   - **Binary Search**: Logarithmic search visualization.
   - **Kadane's Algorithm**: Maximum subarray sum.
   - **And many more...** (Backtracking, DP, Graph traversals, etc.)

### 3. **Interactive Playground**
   - Experiment with array operations in real-time.
   - See immediate visual feedback for your actions.

### 4. **Modern Tech Stack**
   - Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
   - **Framer Motion** for smooth, beautiful animations.
   - **Vite** for lightning-fast development.
